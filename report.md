## Introduction

Instagram is an American photo and video sharing, social media company which was founded in 2010. Many users are teens and adults, who use the platform for texting, sharing stories, posting photographs, and recording videos.

It is a large company in terms of infrastructure. Due to continuous growth, Instagram expanded its operations across the ocean, building data centers in Europe to keep latency low for a better user experience.

## IT Security Plan

### Action Planning

- **System Logs**: Keep logs of users who had access to security controls and track changes made to security settings.
- **Backups**: Regularly back up system files, settings, and confidential data to restore in case of breaches.
- **Access Controls**: Restrict data access based on roles to prevent unauthorized viewing.
- **Risk Assessment**: Perform monthly risk assessments to resolve emerging risks.
- **Training**: Train employees to respond to new threats.
- **Security Patches**: Keep security patches updated to guard against new threats.
